# hello-world
This ist my Hello World! repository on github which I created using the hello-world Github guide. 


I am getting to know how GitHub works in order to use it for a university project. I am pretty excited about it. At the moment I am getting to know the Branch function of GitHub, which will enable me to develop parallel with my teammates.
